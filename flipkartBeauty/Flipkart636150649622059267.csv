Holy Basil, which has the scientific name Ocimum Sanctum is undoubtedly one of the best medicinal herb that has been discovered. It has endless miraculous and medicinal values and has been worshiped and highly valued in our country for thousands of years.Therapeutic Properties: BASIL OIL has a watery viscosity and is pale greenish-yellow in color. The therapeutic properties of basil oil are analgesic, anti-venomous, carminative, cephalic, antidepressant, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, digestive, emmenagogue, expectorant, febrifuge, insecticide, nervine, stomachic, sudorific, tonic and stimulant. This oil plays an active role in treating colds, anxiety, infection, flatulence, fatigue, insect bites and repellant, sinus infection, bronchitis, coughs, depression, abrasions, whooping cough. However, it is made using herbal ingredients that helps in stimulating hair growth. It is also used for indigestion, stress, sinusitis, insect bites, headache, muscle relaxation, anxiety, bacterial infections, depression, panic attacks, hair loss, insomnia, menstrual cramps, intestinal problems, nausea, ear infections, massage, bathing, inhalation, diffusion and as a study aid.Health Benefits of TulsiThe health benefits of tulsi include the following:Fever: The miraculous healing properties of Holy Basil come mainly from its essential oils and the phytonutrients contained in it. Holy Basil is an excellent antibiotic, germicidal, fungicidal and disinfectant agent and very efficiently protects our body from all sorts of bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Fever is mainly caused due to infections from protozoa (malaria), bacteria (typhoid), viruses (flu) and even allergic substances and fungus. Fever is not actually an ailment in itself. It is just a symptom which shows that our body is fighting against less visible infections. The tremendous disinfectant, germicidal and fungicidal properties of tulsi destroys all those pathogens discussed above and heals the resulting feverRespiratory Disorders: Tulsi, along with curing viral, bacterial and fungal infections of the respiratory system, gives miraculous relief in congestion due to the presence of components like Camphene, Eugenol and Cineole in its essential oils. It is very effective in curing almost all varieties of respiratory disorders including bronchitis, both chronic and acute.Asthma: Tulsi is very beneficial in the treatment of asthma, since it relieves congestion and facilitates smoother breathing. The phytonutrients and essential oils, along with the other minerals in it, help cure some of the underlying causes of asthma as well.Lung Disorders: The compounds like vitamin-C, Camphene, Eugenol and Cineole that are present in the essential oils of tulsi do not only cure the infections in the lungs, but also cure congestion of the lungs. Furthermore, they are found to be effective in healing the damages caused to the lungs due to smoking, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. It also helps to cure tuberculosis due to its antibiotic properties.Heart Diseases: Holy Basil contains vitamin-C and other antioxidants such as eugenol, which protect the heart from the harmful effects of free radicals. Additionally, eugenol is very beneficial in reducing the cholesterol levels within the blood.Stress: Vitamin-C and other antioxidants in Holy Basil, apart from repairing damages done by free radicals, also minimize the stress caused by these oxidants. They soothe the nerves, lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation and thus reduce stress. One such component is Camphene. Potassium also reduces blood pressure-related stress by replacing sodium and loosening the tense blood vessels.Oral Care: Tulsi is an excellent mouth freshener and oral disinfectant and its freshness lasts for a very long time. Holy Basil destroys more than 99% of the germs and bacteria in the mouth and this effect can last all day. It also cures ulcers in the mouth. Finally, it is also known to help inhibit the growth of oral cancer which can be caused by chewing tobacco.Dental Care: Holy Basil destroys the bacteria that are responsible for dental cavities, plaque, tartar, and bad breath, while also protecting the teeth. It also has astringent properties which make the gums hold the teeth tighter, thereby keeping them from falling. However, tulsi also has certain compounds like mercury, which has rich germicidal properties, that can actually be harmful for the teeth if kept in direct contact for too long. Therefore, it is advised to avoid chewing these leaves. It is actually discussed in holy books and Ayurvedic teachings that chewing these leaves robs them of their holiness. However, it has no harm if you do not chew it or consume its decoction.Kidney Stones: Tulsi, being a detoxifier and a mild diuretic, helps to reduce the uric acid level in the body, which is the main culprit as far as kidney stones are concerned. It also helps to clean out the kidneys through increased frequency of urination. Acetic acid and certain components in tulsi essential oils also facilitate dissolution of the stones. Finally, it has pain-killer effects and help bear the pain from kidney stones as they pass.Skin Care: Try taking a daily bath with a decoction of Holy Basil mixed with your bathwater, washing your face with it, or simply applying the paste of its leaves on an infected area of the skin in case of skin diseases. You can also just consume tulsi leaves, and still manage to keep your skin free from all infections. You may not believe this, but rubbing Holy Basil leaves or its extracted oils on the body keeps mosquitoes and other insects away. It cures skin disorders both internally and externally, without any side effects. This property mainly comes from its essential oils, which are highly antibiotic, disinfectant, antibacterial and antifungal in nature. External application on the skin also removes extra oil from the skin surface. Camphene in it also gives a soothing, cooling effect.Headache: Headaches caused due to migraines, sinus pressure, cough and cold, or high blood pressure can be effectively controlled by the use of a single tulsi serving. Camphene, Eugenol, Cineol, Carvacrol and Methyl-Chavicol have excellent analgesic, sedative, anticongestive and disinfectant properties.Anti-Aging: Vitamin-C, A, phytonutrients and the essential oils in Holy Basil are excellent antioxidants and protect the body from nearly all the damage caused by free radicals in the body, which are hazardous byproducts of cellular metabolism that are responsible for a wide swath of diseases, including cancer. In the traditional Indian medicine system called Ayurveda, it is considered as a tonic to retain youth and avoid premature aging.Immunity: Holy Basil is so good for boosting up the immune system that it is hard to describe in words. It protects against nearly all infections from viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Recent studies show that it is also helpful in inhibiting the growth of HIV and carcinogenic cells.Eye Care: Wash your eyes daily with a few leaves of basil soaked in water and you will be free from conjunctivitis, boils and many other problems of the eyes which are caused due to viral, bacterial or fungal infections. It also soothes eye inflammation and reduces stress. Regular consumption can protect your eyes from much of the damage done by the free radicals, such as cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma, vision defects, and opthalmia, due to the high antioxidant content of its essential oils, vitamin A, and vitamin C.Other Benefits: It can protect your body from radiation poisoning and also heal and damages from that sort of condition. It can be given after surgery to help heal wounds quickly and also to protect those healing areas from infections. It acts as a vaccine against pox if consumed regularly. It is anticarcinogenic and found to be effective in healing nearly all types of cancer and tumors. Being an expectorant is one of the most prized properties of Holy Basil, making it very efficient in curing coughs and colds. It is beneficial in reducing labor pain, destroying rabies germs, treating gastroenteritis, cholera, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rheumatism, nausea, septic, urinary and genital infections, destroying worms in the stomach. Furthermore, its dried leaves can be mixed with food grains to be used as an insect repellant.

Flipkart,,Deve Herbes Pure Valerian Essential Oil - Valeriana Officinalis(5 ml),"Valerian is a perennial herb with short rhizomes, aromatic feathery leaves and clusters of small pink or white flowers that bloom from June through to September. The plant is native to Europe, North America, and the northern part of Asia. Valerian essential oil is steam distilled from the plant?s rhizomes (roots).Valerian has been used as a medicinal herb since ancient times. Both Hippocrates and Galen recommended Valerian as a remedy for insomnia and it has been used for similar purposes in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Valerian was also used in many traditional love potions and aphrodisiacs. The name Valerian is derived from the Latin verb 'valere' which means 'to be well' or 'to feel good'. The name reflects the medicinal properties of the herb which was also known to herbalists as 'all heal'. Valerian root distilled from the root has been used for centuries. During the last three decades, it has been clinically investigated for its relaxing properties.Researchers have pinpointed the sesquiterpenes, valerenic acid, and valerone as the active constituents that exert a calming and restorative effect on the central nervous system. German health authorities have pronounced valerian to be an effective aid for the body's needs.The fragrance is very calming and grounding to the body and mind. It has a musty and woody aroma that most people either like or don?t like! But, animals seem to resonate very well with this oil.That is why Valerian root is perfect for restlessness, occasional sleeplessness and any accident, trauma or emergency.Valerian is a calming and grounding essential oil with tranquilizing properties. It can help to calm and relax the nervous system and can be beneficial for anxiety, stress, depression, restlessness, insomnia and for helping people cope with emotional trauma and tension.Valerian Root essential oil can assist with pain relief and relax spasms. It is can be used to treat migraines, PMS and painful periods. It can also help to lower blood pressure, stimulate the appetite, improve digestion and help combat stress-related indigestion.",Deve Herbes,http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/deve-herbes-pure-valerian-essential-oil-valeriana-officinalis/p/itme3rd6kgyyrqd7?pid=BEOE3RD65RGJYH4G&affid=siddarthk,http://img.fkcdn.com/image/bath-essential-oil/e/g/g/d-ve-herbes-5-pue-valerian-essential-oil-valeriana-officinalis-200x200-imaeb5ttes8fvjh6.jpeg,Health and Beauty>Bath and Spa>Body and Essential Oils,695.0,595.0,595.0,true,BEOE3RD65RGJYH4G,BEOE3RD65RGJYH4G

The health benefits of nutmeg oil can be attributed to its medicinal properties such as its role as a sedative, stimulant, relaxing, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and bactericidal substance.Nutmeg has the Latin name Myristica fragrans. It is also known by other common names in various countries as mace, muscdier, magic, muskatbaum, noz moscada, myristica, nuez moscada and nux moschata.The nutmeg tree grows very tall and may reach up to seventy feet in height. Nutmeg oil is obtained from the seed of the nutmeg tree fruit. The fruit, when dried, produces nutmeg (the seed) and mace (the covering). Traditionally, nutmeg was believed to be effective against the plague and hence it was popular during the Elizabethan era.The health benefits of nutmeg oil include the following:Pain relief: Nutmeg oil is very useful for treating muscular and joint pain as it is an excellent sedative. Nutmeg oil is also anti-inflammatory, so massaging nutmeg oil on the affected area is an effective treatment for arthritis, rheumatism, and lumbago. Nutmeg oil is an essential part of Chinese medicine when it comes to treating abdominal pain and inflammation. It also reduces swelling of the joints. Often, overexertion leads to body or muscle ache, and in such cases, nutmeg oil can be very useful in removing the pain.Menstrual Cramps: Some women face menstrual irregularities and suffer from menstrual cramps. Nutmeg oil is very helpful for these women, and it can also reduce the associated symptoms of periods like mood swings, depression, and hormone imbalance.Indigestion: Nutmeg oil is good for digestion and helps in relieving stomach aches and removing gas from the stomach and intestines. Therefore, nutmeg oil is good for indigestion, flatulence, vomiting, and diarrhea. It also encourages an increase in appetite. Care should be taken when consuming nutmeg oil, and it should only be applied internally in low doses.Blood Circulation: Nutmeg oil is a good stimulant, not only for the mind, but also for the rest of the body.

It is also antiseptic in nature and is effective for toothaches and aching gums. As a result, it is also added to numerous toothpastes and mouthwashes.Liver Tonic: An important health benefit of nutmeg oil is its ability to treat liver disease. The oil is capable of removing toxins from the liver, thereby making it a good liver tonic.Kidney Health: Nutmeg oil is often recommended for treating kidney infections and kidney diseases.

Flipkart,,Deve Herbes Pure Cumin Seed Essential Oil - Cuminum Cyminum,"Health Benefits of Cumin Essential OilBactericidal: Cumin essential oil is a good bactericide that can be used in the treatment of diarrhea and cholera, which are caused by bacteria. Furthermore, it can cure internal bacterial infections like those in the colon, stomach, intestines and urinary tract, as well as external infections on the skin, ears, eyes, and in wounds.Carminative: Cumin oil has strong carminative properties and effectively drives away gases from the intestines. It also prevents any further formation of gases.Digestive: Cumin oil aids in digestion, but should be taken in low doses. High doses can do the exact reverse and can also make you vomit.

This may sound not that important, but it can be very beneficial for health. Along with urine, fats are lost from the body, up to 4% of the volume of urine. Therefore, it is obvious that the more you urinate, the more fat you lose. Urination also promotes digestion and keeps gas from forming. It removes excess water from the body and reduces swelling. Its biggest contribution is that it helps to remove toxins from the body. What?s more, it also reduces blood pressure. That is the reason that most drugs for lowering blood pressure induce frequent urination. Urination also helps to clean out the kidneys.Antiseptic: The antiseptic properties of Cumin oil do not let the external and internal cuts and wounds become septic.Anti-spasmodic: This oil has very effective anti-spasmodic properties. It can be used in treatment for nearly all sorts of spasms and associated troubles such as cramps, convulsions, non-stop coughs, pains, and cramps.Detoxifier: Cumin oil is an efficient detoxifier. It removes toxins, including those which are produced by the body, such as some excess hormones and metabolic byproducts, as well as those which get into the blood stream through food, such as uric acid, insecticides, synthetic colors, and fertilizers. It promotes sweating and urination, thereby removing the toxins with them.Emenagogue: Cumin oil can help maintain a regular menstruation cycle and can open obstructed menses. It also helps in recovering from Post Menopause Syndromes.Stimulant: It particularly stimulates the digestive and excretory system and keeps them in order.Nervine: Cumin oil is good for the nerves and helps to cure nervous disorders such as convulsions, anxiety, and stress.Tonic: Cumin oil tones up muscles, tissues, and skin, as well as the various systems functioning inside the body, such as the respiratory, circulatory, nervous, digestive, and excretory systems.

Flipkart,,Deve Herbes Pure Eucalyptus Essential Oil,"Eucalyptus OilBotanical Name : Eucalyptus globulesCommon Method Of Extraction : CO2 ExtractionParts Used : Dried leaves and young twigsNote Classification : Top noteAroma : Fresh, woody, camphoraceousExtraction: The essential oil is steam distilled from the dried leaves and young twigs of the eucalyptus tree.Chemical CompositionThe main chemical components are 1,8-cineole, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, aromadendrene, epiglobulol, a-pinene, b-pinene, a-phellandrene, piperitone and globulol.The eucalyptus essential oil is extracted from Myrtaceae, a genus of flowering trees in myrtle family. As a source of wood, the oil finds usage for cleaning functions as a natural insecticide.Properties: Being soluble in alcohol and oils as well as insoluble in water, it is a colorless to pale yellow liquid with CAS of 8000-48-4, specific gravity of 0.858 ? 0.877 @ 20?C, optical rotation of (-2.0) ? (+4.0) @ 20?C and refractive index of 1.450 ? 1.459 @ 20?C.Therapeutic.Properties: The essential oil has therapeutic properties including antispasmodic, expectorant, decongestant and antiviral. The oil provides usefulness in treating cases of bronchitis, bruises, burns, asthma, blisters, catarrh, colds, cystitis, headache, insect bites, measles, mental exhaustion, neuralgia, respiratory infections, skin infections, sore throats, viral infections, wounds.The health benefits of eucalyptus oil include the following:Respiratory problems: Eucalyptus essential oil is effective for treating a number of respiratory problems including cold, cough, runny nose, sore throat, asthma, nasal congestion, bronchitis and sinusitis. Eucalyptus oil is antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and decongestant in nature, which makes it a good ingredient in many medicines that treat respiratory problems. A study published in Laryngoscope in 2004 shows its usefulness in treating non-bacterial sinusitis. Patients suffering from non-bacterial sinusitis showed faster improvement when given medicine containing eucalyptus oil. Gargles of eucalyptus oil mixed with warm water are consistently effective in treating sore throats.Asthma is a condition that affects millions of people around the world, and there are many known treatments for the condition. One of these is the use of eucalyptus essential oil. Simply massage 1-3 drops onto the chest and the soothing effect of the aroma and vapors will calm the throat and dilate the blood vessels, which will allow more oxygen into the lungs and normal breathing can be achieved. The anti-inflammatory properties of eucalyptus essential oil also come into play in using it to get relief from asthmatic symptoms.Wounds: Eucalyptus essential oil has antiseptic qualities because of its germicidal quality. Upon exposure to air, ozone is formed which is a well-researched antiseptic. Therefore, eucalyptus oil is used for healing wounds, ulcers, burns, cuts, abrasions and sores. It is also an effective salve for insect bites and stings. Furthermore, besides soothing the affected area, it also protects the open wound or irritated area from developing infections from microbial activity and exposure to the air.Muscle pain: If you are experiencing joint and muscle pain, massaging eucalyptus oil on the surface of the skin helps to relieve stress and pain. The volatile eucalyptus oil is analgesic and anti-inflammatory in nature. Therefore it is often recommended to patients suffering from rheumatism, lumbago, sprained ligaments and tendons, stiff muscles, aches, fibrosis and even nerve pain. The oil should be massaged in a circular motion on the affected areas of the body.Mental exhaustion:One very important reason that many people use eucalyptus oil is that it creates a cooling and refreshing effect. Normally, people suffering from certain conditions and disorders are slightly sluggish. Eucalyptus oil,a stimulant, removes exhaustion and mental sluggishness and rejuvenates the spirits of the sick. It can also be effective in the treatment of stress and mental disorders.Aside from mental exhaustion, eucalyptus essential oil is commonly used to stimulate mental activity and increase blood flow to the brain. Since the essential oil is considered a vasodilator by many, it means that it increases the blood flow around the body by relaxing the blood vessels and allowing more blood to circulate. Basically, more blood to the brain means more brain power, and eucalyptus essential oil is commonly employed in classrooms as a form of causal aromatherapy to increase student performance. Further, formal research must be done in this area, but all signs point to the positive correlation between brain function and eucalyptus essential oil.Dental care: Eucalyptus essential oil is very effective against cavities, dental plaque, gingivitis and other dental infections owing to its germicidal properties. This is why eucalyptus essential oil is so commonly found as an active ingredient in mouthwash, toothpaste, and other dental hygiene products.Lice: Due to its well-known qualities as a bug repellent and natural pesticide, it is frequently used as a natural treatment of lice. Some of the mainstream treatments of lice can be very severe and damaging to the hair, as well as packed with dangerous chemicals that you don?t want being absorbed into your skin, so combing a few drops of eucalyptus oil through a lice-infested head is a much better and healthier solution.Skin care: Eucalyptus oil is often applied topically to treat skin infections.Diabetes: When ingested, eucalyptus oil can help control blood sugar. Its properties as a vasodilator, mentioned above, mean that the entire body benefits from the increase in blood circulation. Diabetic patients commonly suffer from lack of good circulation, and it can be very dangerous, even resulting in amputation or death. Therefore, it is a good idea to frequently massage eucalyptus oil onto the skin topically, and also inhale it as a vapor to ease the constriction of the blood vessels. For best results, massage it onto the skin after a shower, which also has vasodilating and relaxing qualities that will benefit diabetics.Fever: Eucalyptus oil is also used for treating fever and reducing body temperature. This is why one of the common names of eucalyptus oil is ?fever oil?. It works well when combined with peppermint oil and sprayed on the body as a mixture of a deodorant and a temperature reducer.Intestinal germs: Eucalyptus oil is a vermifuge and is frequently employed to remove germs in the intestine. Studies have shown that ingesting eucalyptus oil can deter many of the bacterial, microbial, and parasitic conditions that arise in the various parts of the body, particularly susceptible areas like the colon and intestine.Room freshener: The antiseptic and deodorant nature of eucalyptus oil makes it a perfect room freshener for hospitals. It also kills bacteria and germs in the air, keeping the environment of the rooms clean and sterilized.Tuberculosis and Pneumonia: Eucalyptus essential oil has plenty of antibacterial and antiseptic qualities, and when massaged onto the chest and used as a vapor rub or inhalant, it can relieve the signs and symptoms of harmful conditions like tuberculosis by clearing the lungs and reducing inflammation. It is best if applied to both the chest and the back, over the area of the lungs.Mouth wash: As mentioned above, the oil is a fundamental ingredient in many mouthwashes and toothpastes. There have been a significant number of studies done on the antimicrobial qualities of essential oils. Eucalyptus essential oil has been shown to protect against microbial growth that can promote a host of different symptoms and diseases in the body.Blends.Well.With: The extracted essential oil blends well with cypress, geranium, ginger, cedarwood, chamomile, grapefruit, lemon, marjoram, juniper, lavender, peppermint, pine, rosemary, thyme.Precautions: Avoid while pregnant, avoid with homeopathic medicine, may cause skin irritationABOUT US: We are one of the largest sellers of essential oils in India, sourcing purest quality of essential & carrier oils from world over.
