It features a specially designed bio-sensor with logic-control IC. When Snore Off Band detects snoring, a gentle 4-second electrical pulse will be sent automatically to stimulate nerves on the snorers skin. Then the brain senses this nerve stimulation, and reminds or train the snorer him/herself to change the sleeping posture, thereby reducing snoring. ::Snore Off Band features these advantages with absolutely no side effects:: Smooth pulse without disturbing normal sleep::Automatically detects snores::Not affected if any buttons pressed while sleeping::Automatic power-off after 12 hours of activation::Fashionable watch-shaped design",Solomon,http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/solomon-anti-snore-wristband/p/itmeb3fa7x6x4hux?pid=ASNEB3FAG5TJN8UF&affid=siddarthk,http://img.fkcdn.com/image/anti-snore-wristband/8/u/f/sno911-solomon-200x200-imaeb2qh2htzgj5b.jpeg,Health and Beauty>Health Care>Health Care Devices>Vaporizers,2998.0,1850.0,1850.0,true,ASNEB3FAG5TJN8UF,ASNEB3FAG5TJN8UF
