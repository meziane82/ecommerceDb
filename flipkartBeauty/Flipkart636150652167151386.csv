It is harvested before the flowers appear and the highest yield is obtained when the grass is fully dried - about one week after it has been cut.There are two varieties of grass from which the oil can be extracted - motia and sofia. We find the sofia chemotype to be far more active and pleasant smelling - and for this reason the oil sold by us is from this chemotype.Because palmarosa oil has a rose-like smell, it is often used by unscrupulous essential oil wholesalers and retailers to adulterate rose essential oil. Please note - we DO NOT adulterate any oils - we only supply pure 100% natural essential oil.It is often used as an ingredient of soaps, perfumes and cosmetics, and is also used in the flavoring of tobacco.Extraction : Palmarosa oil is extracted from the dried grass harvested before it flowers by steam distillation.
