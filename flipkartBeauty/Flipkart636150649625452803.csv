Flipkart,,Deve Herbes Pure Hazelnut Oil - Corylus Avekkana,"Hazel nut: botanical name: corylus avekkanaaroma: light, sweet and nutty properties: fine texture, easily absorbableuses: acne, inflammation, respiratory disorders, hair care, skin care hazelnut oil is an excellent carrier oil made from roasted and cold pressed hazelnuts, which are often referred to as filbert nut and cobnut. Usually this oil is pale yellow in color and, when mixed with an essential oil, spreads an overpowering aroma. Packed with numerous nutrients, this amazing oil can also be used to dress salads and flavor other dishes. Since it is very expensive the use of this oil in regular diet is quite limited. Most importantly, hazelnut oil is used in aromatherapy to treat and nourish the skin, with all the essential vitamins and other nutrients that it contains. One can also use this oil mixed with any creams and lotions. Whatever be the skin type, hazelnut oil can always be used to treat it with the utmost care. Find out more about the uses, health benefits and properties of hazelnut oil in the article given below.hazelnut oil benefits, uses and properties:hazelnut oil acts as an excellent emollient and moisturizer because it has a number of essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid, which can rehydrate the skin. So, this oil is extensively used in treating dry skin. Moreover, this oil is very light and easily gets absorbed into the skin. It also doesn't have any side effects and so it is used in many skin care products. Apart from this, the antibacterial and astringent properties prevent the excessive secretion of skin oil that results in acne, thus maintaining soft skin.the healthy and rejuvenating properties of hazelnut oil make it perfect for body massage. Used as carrier oil in aromatherapy, a hazelnut oil massage can be a soothing experience, relieving one of the physical and mental stresses of daily life. Apart from loosening the tired nerves, a regular massage with this oil helps in cell regeneration and even strengthens the capillaries. So, if you are looking to pamper yourself then a session of aromatherapy with hazelnut oil would be a good option. Many love to use this oil in their skin care treatments as it gets easily absorbed by the skin and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. As a result, this oil is used in many skincare products such as creams, lotions and soaps. Hazelnut oil can also be separately mixed with creams and lotions and applied to the body.this oil is suitable for all and nourishes all types of skin. It is particularly good for sensitive skin. This oil is best suited for those with oily skin as the moisturizing property of hazelnut keeps the skin free from excessive secretions. Also, the astringent properties in the oil tightens the pores and so limits the oil secretions, thus helping to maintain clean and clear skin. Just a drop or two of hazelnut oil is enough to take care of your skin.hazelnut oil can be used as sunscreen as it is able to filter all the harmful rays of the sun. Because of this most sunscreens contain hazelnut oil. For stronger effect you can mix this oil with sesame oil, avocado oil, and walnut oil. Another way to utilize the benefits of hazelnut oil is to mix a drop of this oil in any of your daily cream and lotion, which can then act as the best sun guard.like most of other carrier oils, hazelnut oil is also a rich source of vitamin e. The anti-oxidant properties of this vitamin helps in solving many of the problems associated with ageing. Free radicals cause the maximum amount of damage like the destruction of cells and chapped skin. Regular application of hazelnut oil is able to reverse this process by eliminating the free radicals.coloring the hair is trendy and nowadays more and more people are going for this. But one drawback is that on regular washing the color tends to fade quicker while making the hair dull and rough. To retain your hair color for longer duration, apply hazelnut oil to your hair before shampooing.

Flipkart,,Deve Herbes Pure Lemon Essential Oil,"Lemon OilIn ""Aromatherapy A-Z,"" Patricia Davis writes that it can take up to 3,000 lemons to produce one kilogram of lemon essential oil. Essential lemon oil can benefit users physically, mentally and emotionally.The health benefits of lemon oil can be attributed to its stimulating, calming, carminative, anti-infection, astringent, detoxifying, antiseptic, disinfectant, sleep inducing, and antifungal properties. The benefits of lemon oil include its ability to treat stress disorders, fever, infections, asthma, obesity, insomnia, skin disorders, hair conditions, stomach problems and tiredness.Health Benefits of Lemon OilStress: Lemon oil is calming in nature and therefore helps in removing mental fatigue, exhaustion, dizziness, anxiety, nervousness and nervous tension. It has the ability to refresh the mind by creating a positive mindset and removing negative emotions. It is also believed that inhaling lemon oil helps in increasing concentration and alertness. It can therefore be used as a room freshener in offices to increase the efficiency of the employees.Insomnia: Using lemon oil ensures good sleep and helps people that suffer from insomnia.Immune system: Lemon oil has a high vitamin content, which makes it a wonderful booster for the body?s immune system. It further stimulates white blood cells, thus increasing your ability to fight off diseases. Lemon oil also improves circulation throughout the body.Fever: Lemon oil is effective against infectious diseases such as fever, malaria and typhoid.Stomach ailments: Since lemon oil is carminative, it is used in the treatment of various stomach problems, including indigestion, acidity, upset stomach, and cramps.Hair care: Lemon oil is also effective as a hair tonic. Many people use lemon oil to get strong, healthy and shiny hair. Lemon oil is also used to eliminate dandruff.Skin care: Lemon oil is a good remedy for increasing the luster of dull skin. It is astringent and detoxifying in nature, and rejuvenates sagging or tired-looking skin. Its antiseptic properties help in treating pimples and various skin disorders. Lemon is also recommended for reducing excessive oil on the skin.Other benefits of lemonOther benefits of lemon include the following:Cleaners: Lemon is a good cleaner, which is why it is used for cleansing the body, metal surfaces, dishes, and clothes. It is also a disinfectant, so it is commonly used for cleaning surfaces such as butcher?s knives and blocks that can get contaminated very easily.To Clean Cuts and Scrapes: Essential lemon oil has many properties that are useful when treating cuts and scrapes. Cleaning a scrape or cut is one of the first steps taken to treat it. ""Aromatherapy A-Z"" says essential lemon oil is a powerful antibacterial which is beneficial for preventing infections. Lemon oil works in another way as well. It not only kills bacteria directly, it promotes the body's natural immune defense through increased white blood cell activity. This is also a benefit to anyone who has a cut they want to ensure stays free of infection.As a Disinfectant: People can benefit from essential lemon oil's antibacterial properties in another way. Marge Clark, author of ""Essential Oils and Aromatics,"" says a great way to keep germs from spreading is including essential lemon oil in a spray, diffuser or other aerosol system that will disperse the lemon oil through the air. As the essential lemon oil spreads through the air it disinfects. Anyone in a house where people are sick and germs are being spread can benefit from spraying lemon oil in the air.To Help Stop Minor Bleeding: Lemon oil promotes blood clotting. Patricia Davis recommends using essential lemon oil to help stop nose bleeds. To help facilitate clotting, soak a cotton pad in lemon oil and then place it in the nostril. This will help the bleeding stop sooner.Mental and Emotional Benefits: Essential lemon oil also has mental and emotional benefits. The book ""Daily Aromatherapy"" by Joni Keim and Ruah Bull highlights the positive benefits in these areas. They write that essential lemon oil can be used to help increase mental clarity, improve focus and also promote objectivity. For these reasons ""Essential Oils and Aromatics"" says that lemon oil is a great oil to use to stay on task while studying or maintain attention during a long car ride.ABOUT US: We are one of the largest sellers of essential oils in India, sourcing purest quality of essential & carrier oils from world over.

Once these emotions are released we can see that we are using our addictions to keep an illusionary state.This is fantastic oil for those who are always on the run (adrenal or work addiction) and will not take the time to address their emotional or spiritual path. As we know the addictive path is one of self destruction and burn out, because the physical body can not continue on this path 24 hours a day without repercussions.Root and heart chakras are affected with this oil.Petitgrain helps to clear and tone the skin. It is particularly good for greasy, congested skin, acne, pimples and other blemishes, as it has a mild antiseptic action and helps to control over-active sebum production.

Flipkart,,Deve Herbes Pure Celery Seed Essential Oil - Apium Graveolens,"Celery Seed essential oil is an antioxidant and has antispasmodic properties. Historically used for easing and soothing physical discomforts. Supports healthy liver function and digestive system.Researchers have been studying celery seed because of the compound 3-n-butylphthalide or 3nB. This compound has shown to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol. The compound helps to restore balance in many of the body processes.Celery seed is known to increase the elimination of uric acid and therefore is an excellent aid in the relief of arthritis and rheumatism or with any problem where there is swelling and a high acidic condition, like gout and neuralgia. It helps to release toxins from the blood stream and thus, has been found to have a rejuvenating effect on the liver. The pain from sciatica seems to be greatly reduced when celery seed essential oil (mixed in a carrier oil) is massaged into the lower back and gluteal region and the nervous tension from the stress of the pain is eased with this calming oil. When pain from sciatica or swelling keeps you awake at night, a bath with celery seed and lavender before bed will help you to have a restful night. Even burned in an aroma lamp at bedtime will help soothe the body and mind, allowing for a peaceful sleep.Celery seed is also helpful in relieving dyspepsia, flatulence and indigestion. Its calming effect on stomach acids reduces bloating and stomach discomfort. Its cleansing effect aids the kidneys in releasing toxins and eliminating excess water retention. It has been known to help in weight reduction as it suppresses the hunger cravings and the anxiety of dieting. Useful for the endocrine system, this oil balances menstrual cycles and alleviates cramping and uterine spasming. Celery seed is a great help whenever there is tension from pain, which means it is wonderful for PMS.Celery seed is used in massage preparations for insomnia, headaches, and mental fatigue, especially when stress and fear of a situation is holding them back from making decisions that would ease their mind. It balances the nerves and sedates the brain. In an oil burner, used in combination with frankincense or sandalwood, this soporific oil helps to create a peaceful environment for relaxation. It allows you to sink into a deep somniferous state.Celery Seed opens and expands the heart chakra and helps the heart and crown chakras align. It releases emotions of anger stemming from hurt, not enough, tired and unworthy.This oil specifically helps to resolve and release fatherhood issues. This includes whether an individual is a father, one has issues with your father or with a fatherly figure; or for women who had to assume the role of a mother and father. The stuck emotions are usually associated with the fact that males are typically taught to assume the role as provider and take on the responsibility and burdens for the family?s needs.Positive emotions that are instilled are tenderness and strength of heart allowing the heart to function correctly and be open.Chakra affected: Root, solar plexus and heart chakra.",Deve Herbes,http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/deve-herbes-pure-celery-seed-essential-oil-apium-graveolens/p/itme3rd6bxp8pewx?pid=BEOE3RD6Y5XRF5EW&affid=siddarthk,http://img.fkcdn.com/image/bath-essential-oil/c/m/j/d-ve-herbes-10-pure-celery-seed-essential-oil-apium-graveolens-200x200-imaeb5tt39xuhtgf.jpeg,Health and Beauty>Bath and Spa>Body and Essential Oils,395.0,299.0,299.0,true,BEOE3RD6Y5XRF5EW,BEOE3RD6Y5XRF5EW

Clear your head and reduce stress: Take a sniff of neroli essential oil while commuting to or from work. It’s sure to make rush hour a bit more bearable and your outlook a little brighter.2. Sweet dreams: Put a drop of the essential oil on a cotton ball and tuck it inside your pillowcase to help you relax into a great night’s slumber.3. Acne treatment: Since neroli essential oil has powerful antibacterial properties, it’s a great home remedy for acne to treat breakouts. Wet a cotton ball with water (to provide some dilution to the essential oil), and then add a few drops of neroli essential oil. Dab the cotton ball on the problem area gently once a day until the blemish clears up. 4. Purify the air: Diffuse neroli essential oil in your home or office to clean the air and breathe in its anti-germ properties.5. Soak away stress: To naturally remedy anxiety, depression, hysteria, panic, shock and stress, use 3-4 drops of neroli essential oil in your next bath or foot bath.6. Alleviate headaches: Apply a few drops to a hot or cold compress to soothe a headache, especially one caused by tension.7. Lower blood pressure: By using neroli essential oil in a diffuser or just taking a few sniffs of it right out of the bottle, studies have shown blood pressure as well as cortisol levels can be lowered.8. Regenerate skin: Mix a drop or two of neroli essential oil with an application of an unscented face cream or oil (like jojoba or argan), and apply as normal.9. PMS relief: For a natural remedy for PMS cramps, mix a few drops of neroli into your bathwater.10. Natural antispasmodic: Use 2-3 drops in a diffuser or 4-5 drops in a blended massage oil and rub it over the lower abdomen to improve colon problems, diarrhea and nervous dyspepsia.11. Ease labor: Childbirth is certainly far from easy, but the essential oil of neroli can be used to help with fear and anxiety during labor. Diffuse it in the air, or include it in a massage oil for the lower back.12. Decrease stretch marks: Add a few drops of neroli essential oil to a cream, lotion or oil to reduce stretch marks and broken capillaries on the skin.",khadi Natural,http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/khadi-natural-neroli-essential-oil/p/itme2ykdbnd2yceq?pid=BEOE2YKDXGAJTSBZ&affid=siddarthk,http://img.fkcdn.com/image/bath-essential-oil/s/b/z/khadi-natural-15-neroli-essential-oil-200x200-imaeg3tqhwzprwzy.jpeg,Health and Beauty>Bath and Spa>Body and Essential Oils,350.0,252.0,252.0,true,BEOE2YKDXGAJTSBZ,BEOE2YKDXGAJTSBZ
